In this excerise you will implement a LRU (Least recently used) doublely linked list. In an LRU list the nodes are
ordered by the time in which they were recently accessed. (From Least Recently Used to Most recently used)


             --------------       --------------
            |   key        |     |   key        |
            |   Item       |     |   Item       |
    null<-- |   Previous   |<--- |   Previous   |
            |   Next       |---->|   Next       |--->null
             --------------       --------------
                    ^
                    |
                    |
              Least Recently
                 Accessed

Your doublely linked List will have fixed capacity (n). If an element is added to the full linked list it will replace
the tail of the link list (The least recently used item).  When an element is accessed it moved to the head of the list.

Implement the double linked list by completig the associated skeleton code.
